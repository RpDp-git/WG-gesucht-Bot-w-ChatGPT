# WG-gesucht-Bot-w-ChatGPT-
A scraping and messaging bot for wg-gesucht.de. To help find accommodation in the competitive German rental housing market

Are you tired of constantly refreshing wg-gesucht.de in hopes of being the first to message potential roommates? Look no further, because I've built a solution to save you time and increase your chances of securing a room in a shared flat!

My python program is designed to scrape information from wg-gesucht.de and automatically send a customized message to potential roommates. By being the first to message, you increase your chances of being considered for the room. But that's not all - the program also analyzes the room description to find common interests and hobbies among the current roommates, allowing you to tailor your message and make a more personal connection.

How does it work, you ask? The program uses the chat gpt API to generate personalized message content based on the room description and your provided information. This API uses machine learning algorithms to generate human-like responses, making the message feel more natural and less like a generic copy-paste.

But don't worry - this isn't just a mindless bot spamming potential roommates. The program includes built-in safety measures to ensure that messages are sent at appropriate intervals and don't violate any terms of service.

Overall, my program can save you time and increase your chances of securing a room in a shared flat. So why waste any more time constantly refreshing a web page when you can let the bot do the work for you? Try it out for yourself and take the first step towards finding your perfect living arrangement.
